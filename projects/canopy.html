description: "Canopy is a web testing framework with one goal in mind, make UI testing simple. It's solid stabilization layer built on top of Selenium that brings death to brittle, quirky, UI tests. It has really clean, concise API that's really easy and quick to learn even if you've never done UI Automation, and don't know F#."
